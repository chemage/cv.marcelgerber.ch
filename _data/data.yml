    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Below is a brief summary of the below paragraphs.

      - Close to **15 years** of experience in multi-site companies
      - Alignment with **business strategies** and goals
      - Encourage the **exchange** of experience and knowledge
      - Help team to **focus** on interesting and valuable tasks / projects
      - Ability to **relate to others**, customer oriented, open-minded and creative thinking
      - Some of my **key skills**: independent, team work, efficient, reliable, honest
      - IT **generalist** with a **wide scope** of skills and interests

      After over ten years at various positions in information technology, 
      operating IT infrastructures, leading IT projects and providing support, 
      I have evolved to team lead. My latest focus is to develop further management 
      skills and to reach that goal, I have started the **brevet fédéral de gestion 
      d'équipe** (Swiss federal patent of team lead) in April 2023.
      
      I am a sociable person with good interpersonal skills, which I put to good 
      use for external and internal relationships. People are happy to have me as 
      a professional partner for projects, tasks and general operations. 
      
      My motivation stems from the following:
      1. **What I like best**, is developing personal skills, be it technical or interpersonal.
      1. **What I do best** is improving a team’s efficiency by helping implementing new 
      collaboration methods.
      
      It is always with great pleasure that I use my different language skills, be it 
      with users or partners. I left out Spanish, which I only gabble a little.
      
      Some of my key technical skills include learning about new technologies, 
      scripting in various languages and implementing system software.
      
      My responsibilities usually include coordinating, various internal and external 
      partners, creating simple and helpful documentation, follow change and transmit 
      know-how to other teams.
      
      Everybody has her/his own set of skills, so it is important to me to be able to 
      convey technical matters in a comprehensive manner to non-technical people and to 
      further each person’s competencies.
      
      I work independently and assume responsibility for my decisions, I take 
      initiatives and envision the bigger picture.

          working on analysis and troubleshooting of incidents, implementing change requests in
          networking and security areas of managed services and support customers.

          system so that it becomes more efficient to work with, improving processes and documention. 
          From the start, I also positioned myself as an internal IT helper which allowed me to

        time: 2012 - 2014 (3 years)
        company: the world
        details: |
          During this time, I left first for Mozambique where I learned how to be a 
          proficient PADI divemaster. I continued with traveling most of the countries
          in southern Africa. During the travelling period, I used land-based local transportation
          exclusively, which put me in some interesting situations.

          I returned to Switzerland to volunteer at Paléo Festival for the whole set-up and 
          tear-down, which took about 3 months all in all.

          After this I worked a year for ATI Stellram as an IT Helpdesk Operator. The
          company was in the process of being aquired by Kennametal.

          The last phase of my personal break was completing my PADI education with the
          Open Water Scuba Instructor in Costa Rica. From where I jumped over to the Dominican 
          Republic for a stunt at the job and then over to Cambodia. There I discovered 
          South East Asia using local transportation for a period of about 6 months.

          During the time it took to hire a new and trained IT manager, which would become 
          the IT Director (not being part of finance department anymore), I was able to take
          this responsibility.

projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: >
      These are some projects I was able to accomplish.
    assignments:
      - title: Implementing and follow-up of an on-going training plan for the Operations & Support team @ BNC
        tagline: >
          During my job interview, I was told I would be able to benefit from vendor trainings to 
          help me get up on speed with the many different technologies we are implementing and managing
          for managed services and support customers.

          The reality was slightly different: after a couple of months I was dropped into dispatching and
          incident resolution without prior training.

          I was able to setup a training plan (customized for each team member), which is aligned with our
          business needs at the moment and in a projected mid-term future.

          Out newly hired staff now start with vendor trainings and certifications in addition to the internal
          training.

      - title: Re-design the organization and operations of the Operations & Support team @ BNC
        tagline: >
          When I started at BNC, the dispatcher did everything by himself from creating the ticket to 
          working towards its resolution or reassigning it to other teams.

          For this job I reviewed and updated processes, workflow diagrams and guidelines.

          At the end of this project, the dispatcher had different tasks which include:
          - Open tickets from the monitoring system, the customers and the vendors (vulnerabilities);
          - Have a good overview of current issues and help identify recurring issues.
          - Review and cleanup of old problems still active in the monitoring system;

      - title: Migration of Citrix hosting from XenServer to VMware @ Unilabs
        # link: "#hook"
        tagline: >
          Participate in VMware ESX preparation, configure Citrix hosting for VMware, 
          move all existing master images from XenServer to VMware, create new machine 
          catalogs for VMware and seamlessly move users to the VMware hosted worker machines.

      - title: Full Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops deployment @ Unilabs
        tagline: >
          At Unilabs, the production environment was fully in place. All I needed to do 
          was create and use strict processes. But for the pre-production environment, 
          what was available was obsolete and not working.
          
          The tasks for this included the following:
          • Set up Citrix Delivery Controllers;
          • Set up Citrix ADC Load Balancers;
          • Set up Citrix ADC Access Gateway;
          • Create master machines;
          • Deploy applications for testing purposes.
        
      # - title: Deploying LIS (laboratory information software) using Citrix XenApp & Desktop @ Unilabs
      #   tagline: >
      #     The LIS for F-CH labs, called Jade, is written using an old version of Java.

      #     Some system and scripting cause some parts of the software not to work as expected, 
      #     which creates many challenges to implement a solution which works as fast as possible 
      #     with a minimum of issues. We needed to include stakeholders and laboratory users.
        
      - title: Windows 7 replacement for Windows 2003 and Windows XP back office devices @ McDonald's
        tagline: >
          Working towards a new solution with SCCM software deployments and minimal manual 
          intervention.
          
          Redefinition of strategies like user document location.
          
          Scripted an almost completely automated Windows 7 image deployment to remote 
          locations using Powershell.

          This project needed careful planning with the operations and the local restaurant teams.
        
      - title: Designing new Windows 7 virtual machine for restaurant management for the Swiss market @ McDonald’s
        tagline: >

        tagline: >
          Driving an external partner to prepare and upgrade two restaurant management 
          software to a single version of each software, also harmonizing their configuration 
          and management.
          
          Part of task:
          • Specify requirements and managing external partner to their fulfilment;
          • Prepare and send communication to the franchisees and restaurants;
          • Prepare and drive the deployment of the upgrades.

      - title: Hardware replacement for time-punching device @ McDonald’s
        tagline: >

      - title: VMware virtualisation infrastructure @ Manpower
        tagline: >
          Implementing, managing and growing of a virtualisation infrastructure in a SAN environment.

          After implementing a first draft with the help of a third-party provider, we quickly realized
          that the design would not be working on the long-term.

          After a SAN crash, we had to rebuild everything from scratch, project I led and implemented
          without external help.

      - title: Virtual desktop infrastructure @ Manpower
        tagline: >
          Implementing, managing and maintaining a VDI infrastructure with Citrix XenDesktop.

          For this project, we requested help from my previous employer, PSS SA, with whom
          we spent some time setting up the environment and first golden image. After that,
          I was able to operate the environment on my own.

      - title: Backup restructuring @ Manpower
        tagline: >
          Restructuring of a multiple tape drives and library backup to a disk backup and 
          tape duplication system with a single tape library.

        tagline: >
          Redesigning security scopes for IT tasks in Active Directory for Helpdesk, Admins

          With the help from a third-party provider, I set up my first image deployment automation
          solution. Once in place, the Helpdesk team members were able to deploy the latest image 
          on workstations in all of the remote locations.
